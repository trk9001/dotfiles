# Prepend $PWD/.direnv/bin to the $PATH if it exists; this is useful if we need
# to use tools (or specific versions of tools) that are only applicable in the
# current directory tree.
#
# E.g.: kubectl v1.30 is installed system-wide, but for one project we need
# kubectl v1.27. With this snippet, we can put the kubectl v1.27 binary in the
# project's .direnv/bin directory, and continue to invoke kubectl just as we
# normally would.
